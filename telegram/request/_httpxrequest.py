    `httpx <https://www.python-httpx.org>`_`.

    Args:
        connection_pool_size (:obj:`int`, optional): Number of connections to keep in the
            connection pool. Default to :obj:`1`.
        proxy_url (:obj:`str`, optional): The URL to the proxy server. For example
            ``'http://127.0.0.1:3128'``. Defaults to :obj:`None`.
        connect_timeout (:obj:`float`, optional): The maximum amount of time (in seconds) to wait
            for a connection attempt to a server to succeed. :obj:`None` will set an infinite
            timeout for connection attempts. Defaults to ``5.0``.
        read_timeout (:obj:`float`, optional): The maximum amount of time (in seconds) to wait for
            a response from Telegram's server. :obj:`None` will set an infinite timeout. This value
            is usually overridden by the various methods of :class:`telegram.Bot`. Defaults to
            ``5.0``.
        write_timeout (:obj:`float`, optional): The maximum amount of time (in seconds) to wait for
            a write operation to complete (in terms of a network socket; i.e. POSTing a request or
            uploading a file).:obj:`None` will set an infinite timeout. Defaults to ``5.0``.
        pool_timeout (:obj:`float`, optional): Timeout waiting for a connection object to become
            available and returned from the connection pool. :obj:`None` will set an infinite
            timeout. Defaults to ``1.0``.
